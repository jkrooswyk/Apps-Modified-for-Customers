# Apps-Modified-for-Customers

Attachment Hunter - This custom app finds all user stories, defects, and tasks which have attachments.

Cross Release Story Burnup - This derivative of Barry Mullan's app burns up stories across multiple PSI's/Releases.

Enhanced Velocity Chart Calculates All Accepted Work Even Late - This app is a modified version of the Enhanced Velocity Chart in the Rally App Catalog.  It is for organizations that perpetually accept their work after the iteration ends, but need to see how much work on average is getting done.  The standard app in the catalog ignores late work.

Estimation Board Filtered By Iteration - This is a modified version of the Estimation Board in the Rally App Catalog.  This version filters the work by iteration.

Estimation Board Filtered By Release - This is a modified version of the Estimation Board in the Rally App Catalog.  This version filters the work by release.

Estimation Board Unplanned Filtered by Owner - This is a modified version of the Estimation Board in the Rally App Catalog.  This version only displays unplanned work (not part of an iteration), and is filterable by owner.

Individual Actuals Burndown - This modified version of the personal burndown chart includes Task Actuals.

Planned Vs Actual Respects Release Name - The modified version of the Planned vs Actual Release app from the Rally App Catalog respects the Release Name.  The version in the app catalog respects the release time box, not the name.  For organizations with overlapping releases, this can be critical to making this app work correctly.
